## Installation
r[API]dito should be placed in **/var** folder, it can be executed without problems since you configure it correctly and grant permission accordingly to the admin user you've created in Smart Console.

For stable released versions the parent folder should be named as **rapidito** and beta version as **rapibeta**. By default the ownership of files is **admin** for user and group. 

- First, move the main folder to **/var** directory.

  `[user@sms]# mv rapidito/ /var/`

- Inside Smart Console terminal, dentify which is the user you are working on and grant permissions as follows. 

  `[user@sms]# chown -R $(grep -i $(whoami) /etc/passwd | cut -d':' -f1): /var/rapidito` 

- For ensuring security, take off permission to `others` users and grant just only `owner` user. 
  
  `[user@sms]# chmod -R u+rwx /var/rapidito`

- Inside the `setup` folder, run the `./install.sh` file.

- Finally, logout from current terminal and login again, now just type on terminal
    
    `[user@sms]# rapidito`

- r[API]dito will start, that's all.

* There is one file within **config** folder called `init.rap`, in this file you can edit and change for the name of your existing groups in SmartConsole!
